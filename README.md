## Name:
## Github username:
Your task is to implement a data profile of a person containing at least the following data. More is appreciated :blush:

* First name
* Last name
* Age
* Address
* Married
* Salary

Use **every** primitive datatype we have learned so far and of course Strings. Every variable must be declared and initialised.

**NOTE:**
Use self explaining variable names and do not forget about the coding standards.
